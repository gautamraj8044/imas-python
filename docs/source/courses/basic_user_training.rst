IMASPy 101
==========

In this IMASPy training, we introduce you to the basic concepts and features of
IMASPy. You will need some basic familiarity with Python. For a refresher, see
the `Python tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>`_. We also asume
some basic knowledge of the ITER IMAS infrastructure, for which the entry page
is https://imas.iter.org. To get access to the nessecary knowledge and tooling
to start using IMASPy, including an already installed IMASPy, follow the excellent
`Getting Started <https://confluence.iter.org/display/IMP/Getting+Started>`_
until "How to read / write IMAS data", after which you can follow the IMASPy
specific guide below.
