IMASPy 101: setup IMASPy
========================

This course was written for IMASPy version 0.8.0 and requires an IMAS installation to
load IMAS data. IMASPy may be installed on your cluster, in which case you can do

.. code-block:: console

    $ module load IMASPy IMAS
    $ python -c 'import imaspy; print(imaspy.__version__)'
    0.8.0

Have a look at the :ref:`Installing IMASPy` page for more details on installing IMASPy.
